Simple Calculator (Work in Progress)
This is a basic calculator built with JavaScript as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It handles simple arithmetic operations and includes input limits and responsive text resizing.

I spent a bit too long tweaking it, so Iâ€™ve decided to move on for now to continue progressing through the rest of the course. Will probably revist later.
